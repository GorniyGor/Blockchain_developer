###Result:
- My Profile ID on Ceramic network: 
>`did:pkh:eip155:5:0x1d99eCBe6e9Aa0aEe423021F4548DeB577937484`

But there is required to have Name to create Profile and my Update function doesn't work of me (I have checked with another guy my code it works for him).
- Finally, to pass the test I have created a profile through official site https://clay.self.id/
>id: `did:3:kjzl6cwe1jw14amm0te2db4724v6oyojnq9wr7f857nj6pfpsjuneocuwoho889`
